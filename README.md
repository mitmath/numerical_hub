# Interdisciplinary Numerical Methods: "Hub" 18.S190/16.S090

This new MIT course (**Spring 2025**) introduces numerical methods and numerical analysis to a broad audience (assuming 18.03, 18.06, or equivalents, and some programming experience).  It is divided into two 6-unit halves:

*  **18.S190/16.S090** (first half-term “hub”): basic numerical methods, including curve fitting, root finding, numerical differentiation and integration, numerical differential equations, and floating-point arithmetic. Emphasizes the complementary concerns of accuracy and computational cost.  [Prof. Steven G. Johnson](http://math.mit.edu/~stevenj) and [Prof. Qiqi Wang](https://aeroastro.mit.edu/people/qiqi-wang/).

*   Second half-term: three options for 6-unit “spokes”

    *   18.S191/16.S091 — numerical methods for partial differential equations: finite-difference and finite-volume methods, boundary conditions, accuracy, and stability. [Prof. Qiqi Wang](https://aeroastro.mit.edu/people/qiqi-wang/).

    *   18.S097/16.S097 — large-scale linear algebra: sparse matrices, iterative methods, randomized methods. [Prof. Steven G. Johnson](http://math.mit.edu/~stevenj).

    *   18.S192/16.S098 — parallel numerical computing: multi-threading and distributed-memory, and trading off computation for parallelism — _may be taken simultaneously_ with other spokes! [Prof. Alan Edelman](https://math.mit.edu/~edelman/).

Taking both the hub and any spoke will count as an 18.3xx class for math majors, similar to 18.330.  Taking both the hub and the PDE spoke will substitute for 16.90. Weekly homework, *no exams*, but spokes will include a final project.

This repository is for the "hub" course (currently assigned the temporary numbers 18.S190/16.S090).

## Lecture 1 (Feb 3)

* Finite-difference approximations: [Julia notebook and demo](notes/finite-differences.ipynb)

Brief overview of the huge field of numerical methods, and outline of the small portion that this course will cover. Key new concerns in numerical analysis, are (i) performance (traditionally, arithmetic counts, but now memory access often dominates) and (ii) accuracy (both floating-point roundoff errors and also convergence of intrinsic approximations in the algorithms).  In contrast, the more pure, abstract mathematics of continuity is called "analysis", and is mainly concerned with (ii) but not (i): they are happy to prove that limits converge, but don't care too much how *quickly* they converge.  Whereas traditional discrete computer science is concerned with mainly with (i) but not (ii): they care about performance and resource usage, but traditional algorithms like sorting are either right or wrong, never approximate.

As a starting example, considered the the convergence of **finite-difference approximations** to derivatives df/dx of given functions f(x), which appear in many areas of numerical analysis (such as solving differential equations) and are also closely tied to *polynomial approximation and interpolation*.   By examining the errors in the finite-difference approximation, we immediately see *two* competing sources of error: *truncation* error from the non-infinitesimal Δx, and *roundoff* error from the finite precision of the arithmetic.  Understanding these two errors will be the gateway to many other subjects in numerical methods.

**Further reading**: [FNC book: Finite differences](https://fncbook.com/finitediffs), [FENA book: chapter 2](https://www-cambridge-org.libproxy.mit.edu/core/books/fundamentals-of-engineering-numerical-analysis/numerical-differentiation-finite-differences/96E5E7ED237DF7FD71F8B0F7DCA2EF7A).  There is a lot of information online on [finite difference approximations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference),  [these 18.303 notes](https://github.com/mitmath/18303/blob/fall16/difference-approx.pdf), or [Section 5.7 of *Numerical Recipes*](http://www.it.uom.gr/teaching/linearalgebra/NumericalRecipiesInC/c5-7.pdf).   The Julia [FiniteDifferences.jl package](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/FiniteDifferences.jl) provides lots of algorithms to compute finite-difference approximations; a particularly robust and powerful way to obtain high accuracy is to employ [Richardson extrapolation](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/FiniteDifferences.jl#richardson-extrapolation) to smaller and smaller δx.  If you make δx too small, the finite precision (#digits) of [floating-point arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic) leads to [catastrophic cancellation errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophic_cancellation).

## Lecture 2 (Feb 5)

* [Floating-point introduction](notes/Floating-Point-Intro.ipynb)

One of the most basic sources of computational error is that **computer arithmetic is generally inexact**, leading to [roundoff errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-off_error).  The reason for this is simple: computers can only work with numbers having a **finite number of digits**, so they **cannot even store** arbitrary real numbers.  Only a _finite subset_ of the real numbers can be represented using a particular number of "bits", and the question becomes _which subset_ to store, how arithmetic on this subset is defined, and how to analyze the errors compared to theoretical exact arithmetic on real numbers.

In **floating-point** arithmetic, we store both an integer coefficient and an exponent in some base: essentially, scientific notation. This allows large dynamic range and fixed _relative_ accuracy: if fl(x) is the closest floating-point number to any real x, then |fl(x)-x| < ε|x| where ε is the _machine precision_. This makes error analysis much easier and makes algorithms mostly insensitive to overall scaling or units, but has the disadvantage that it requires specialized floating-point hardware to be fast. Nowadays, all general-purpose computers, and even many little computers like your cell phones, have floating-point units.

Went through some simple definitions and examples in Julia (see notebook above), illustrating the basic ideas and a few interesting tidbits.  In particular, we looked at **error accumulation** during long calculations (e.g. summation), as well as examples of [catastrophic cancellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_of_significance) and how it can sometimes be avoided by rearranging a calculation.

**Further reading:** [FNC book: Floating-poing numbers](https://fncbook.com/floating-point).  [Trefethen & Bau's *Numerical Linear Algebra*](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/text.html), lecture 13. [What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating Point Arithmetic](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.22.6768) (David Goldberg, ACM 1991). William Kahan, [How Java's floating-point hurts everyone everywhere](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/JAVAhurt.pdf) (2004): contains a nice discussion of floating-point myths and misconceptions.   A brief but useful summary can be found in [this Julia-focused floating-point overview](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/psa-floating-point-arithmetic/8678) by Prof. John Gibson. Because many programmers never learn how floating-point arithmetic actually works, there are [many common myths](https://github.com/mitmath/18335/blob/spring21/notes/fp-myths.pdf) about its behavior.   (An infamous example is `0.1 + 0.2` giving `0.30000000000000004`, which people are puzzled by so frequently it has led to a web site [https://0.30000000000000004.com/](https://0.30000000000000004.com/)!)

## Lecture 3 (Feb 7)

* Interpolation [OneNote Notebook](https://mitprod-my.sharepoint.com/personal/qiqi_mit_edu/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc={24321bd2-8c69-451a-b0cc-c2b42aed5743}&action=view&wd=target%28Interpolation%20and%20Curve%20Fitting%2F20250207.one%7C2528b4d7-6843-4fa0-ab2b-e6fa127e8352%2F%29&wdorigin=717) [Code](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1khUewCdh5Io97dry6O5pZNaP7_4w8QFC?usp=sharing) [Complete Notes](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NyU48yqYY91h2a6sZZvr1WcFUxCiDZXS?usp=sharing)
* [pset 1](psets/pset1.ipynb): due Feb 14

Discussed the important problem of **interpolating** a function $f(x)$ from a set of discrete data points, which shows up in a vast number of real problems and connects to many other areas of numerical methods (e.g. differentiation and integration).  To begin with, considered the simplest algorithm of [piecewise linear interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation) in one dimension, with points $x$ at spacing $\Delta x$, and showed that (for a twice-differentiable function) the error (the difference between the interpolant and the true function) converges as $O(\Delta x^2)$ (second-order convergence).

**Further reading:** [FNC chapter 5](https://fncbook.com/overview-4) and FENA chapter 1.  Piecewise linear interpolation is implemented in Python by [`numpy.interp`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.interp.html#numpy.interp), and several other interpolation schemes by [`scipy.interpolate`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-1.15.1/tutorial/interpolate.html).  Interpolation packages in Julia include [Interpolations.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMath/Interpolations.jl), [Dierckx.jl (splines)](https://github.com/JuliaMath/Dierckx.jl),  [BasicInterpolators.jl](https://github.com/markmbaum/BasicInterpolators.jl), and [FastChebInterp.jl (high-order polynomials)](https://github.com/JuliaMath/FastChebInterp.jl).

## Lecture 4 (Feb 10)
* Notes: [OneNote Notebook](https://mitprod-my.sharepoint.com/personal/qiqi_mit_edu/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc={24321bd2-8c69-451a-b0cc-c2b42aed5743}&action=view&wd=target%28Interpolation%20and%20Curve%20Fitting%2F20250210.one%7Cd3d07c1f-f11c-4397-a2c2-a16b1dbb16bf%2F%29&wdorigin=717)

One approach to generalizing piecewise-linear interpolation is to interpolate $n$ points with a polynomial $p(x)$ of degree of degree $n-1$.  This is an important technique for many applications, and the general topic of approximating functions by polynomials has vast importance in numerical analysis, but requires care if $n$ becomes much larger than 4 (cubic) or so, even for smooth functions (no noise).

A general conceptual approach is to set up a system of linear equations for the polynomial coefficients $c_i$, satisfying $p(x_k) = y_k$ for each data point $(x_k, y_k)$.  This can be expressed in matrix form $Ac = y$, where the $n \times n$ matrix $A$ is known as a [Vandermonde matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandermonde_matrix) if you are using the usual monomial basis $p(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + \cdots$.   One quickly runs into two difficulties, however:

1. The matrix $A$ is **nearly singular** for large $n$ in the monomial basis, so floating-point roundoff errors are exacerbated.  (We will say that it has a large [condition number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condition_number) or is "ill-conditioned", and will define this more precisely next time.)   **Solution:** It turns out that monomials are just a poorly behaved basis for high-degree polynomials, and it is much better to use [orthogonal polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_polynomials), most commonly [Chebyshev polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials), as a basis — with these, people regularly go to degrees of thousands or even millions.

2. Polynomial interpolation from **equally spaced points** (in *any* basis!) can **diverge exponentially** from the underlying "true" smooth function **in between the points** (even in exact arithmetic, with no roundoff errors!).  This is called a [Runge phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%27s_phenomenon).   **Solution 1**: Use carefully chosen non-equispaced points.  A good choice that leads to *exponentially good* polynomial approximations (for smooth functions) is the [Chebyshev nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_nodes), which are clustered near the endpoints.  **Solution 2**: use a *lower* degree ($<< n$) polynomial and perform an *approximate fit* to the given points, rather than requiring the polynomial to go through them exactly.  (More on this soon.)

If you address both of these problems, high-degree polynomial approximation can be a fantastic tool for describing *smooth* functions.  If you have *noisy* data, however, you should typically use much lower-degree polynomials to avoid [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting) (trying to match the noise rather than the underlying "true" function).

**Further reading**: [FNC book, chapter 9](https://fncbook.com/polynomial).  Beware that the FENA book starts with the ["Lagrange formula"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_polynomial) for the interpolating polynomial, but this formula is very badly behaved ("numerically unstable") for high degrees and should not be used; it is superseded by the "barycentric" Lagrange formula (see FNC book; [reviewed in much more detail by Berrut and Trefethen, 2004](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/barycentric.pdf)).  The subject of polynomial interpolation is the entry point into [approximation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation_theory); if you are interested, the [book by Trefethen](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/ATAP/) and accompanying [video lectures](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/atapvideos.html) are a great place to get more depth.    The [`numpy.polynomials`](https://numpy.org/doc/2.2/reference/routines.polynomials.html) module contains a variety of functions for polynomial interpolation, including with Chebyshev polynomials.  A package for multi-dimensional Chebyshev polynomial interpolation in Julia is [FastChebInterp](https://github.com/JuliaMath/FastChebInterp.jl).  A pioneering package that shows off the power of Chebyshev polynomial interpolation is [`chebfun` in Matlab](https://www.chebfun.org/), along with [related packages in other languages](https://www.chebfun.org/about/projects.html).  (This approach is taken to supercomputing extremes by the [Dedalus package](https://dedalus-project.org/) to solve partial differential equations using exponentially converging polynomial approximations.)   It turns out that if you are interpolating using Chebyshev polynomials, and you choose your points $x_k$ to be Chebyshev points (either extrema or roots of the degree $n$ Chebyshev polynomial), then you don't need to form any Vandermonde-like matrix explicitly — you can get the coefficients *much* more quickly, in $O(n \log n)$ operations, using [fast Fourier transforms (FFTs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform); given these, a polynomial in the Chebyshev basis can then be evaluated at any $x$ with $O(n)$ operations using the [Clenshaw algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clenshaw_algorithm).  If you don't need the explicit coefficients, the barycentric Lagrange formula (for an arbitrary set of points) has $O(n^2)$ setup cost to obtain a set of weights from the $x_k$ — still cheaper than the $O(n^3)$ cost of solving the Vandermonde system — after which the polynomial can be evaluated cheaply ($`O(n)`$) at any point $x$ similar to the other schemes.

## Lecture 5 (Feb 12)

* [handwritten notes](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/m691ghxq38a6lnoayrfxz/Condition-Numbers.pdf?rlkey=3x45kla27gcve0l2qv0d76sxi&st=i7kdwkps&dl=0)

The goal of this lecture is to precisely define the notion of a [condition number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condition_number), which quantifies the *sensitivity* of a function f(x) to *small perturbations* in the input.  A function that has a "large" condition number is called "ill-conditioned", and *any* algorithm to compute it may suffer inaccurate results from any sort of error (whether it be roundoff errors, input noise, or other approximations) — it doesn't mean you can't use that function, but it usually means you need to be careful (about both implementation and about interpretation of the results).

For a given function $f(x)$ (with inputs and outputs in any normed vector space), the two important quantities are:
* **absolute** condition number $\kappa_a(f, x) = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0^+} \sup_{\Vert \delta x \Vert = \epsilon} \frac{\Vert \overbrace{f(x + \delta x) - f(x)}^{\delta f} \Vert}{\Vert \delta x \Vert}$.  It is the *worst case* $\Vert \delta f \Vert / \Vert \delta x \Vert$ for any arbitrarily small input perturbation $\delta x$.   Unfortunately, if the inputs and outputs of $f$ have different scales ("units"), then $\kappa_a$ may be hard to interpret (it is "dimensionful").
* **relative** condition number $\kappa_r(f, x) = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0^+} \sup_{\Vert \delta x \Vert = \epsilon} \frac{\Vert \delta f \Vert / \Vert f(x) \Vert}{\Vert \delta x \Vert / \Vert x \Vert} = \kappa_a(f, x) \frac{\Vert  x \Vert}{\Vert f(x) \Vert}$.  This is a dimensionless quantity: it is the maximum ratio of the *relative change in f* to the *relative change in x*.   Most of the time, $\kappa_r$ is the quantity of interest.

All of these quantities involve the central concept of a [norm ‖⋯‖](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normed_vector_space), which is a way of measuring the "length" of a vector.   The most familar norm, and usually the default or implicit choice for column vectors $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, is the [Euclidean or "L₂" norm](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/L2-Norm.html) $\sqrt{x^T x}$, but other popular norms include the [L₁ norm](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/L1-Norm.html) (the ["taxicab" norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry)) and the [maximum norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_distance) ($L_\infty$).  It turns out that all norms differ by [at most an n-dependent constant factor](https://github.com/mitmath/18335/blob/spring21/notes/norm-equivalence.pdf), so the choice of norms is mostly one of convenience if you don't care about constant factors, e.g. if you are comparing $O(\varepsilon)$ to $O(\varepsilon^2)$, but it can make a big difference in optimization/fitting (e.g. different forms of regression or regularization).

For example, looked at the condition number of summation $f(x) = \sum_i x_i$.  In the $L_1$ norm, the absolute condition number is $\kappa_a = 1$, and the relative condition number is $\kappa_r = \sum_i |x_i| / |\sum_j x_j |$, which gives $\kappa_r = 1$ when all the summands $x_i$ have the same sign, but blows up $\to \infty$ as $\sum_j x_j \to 0$ (for $x \ne 0$) — this is an "ill-conditioned" sum where you can expect a large *relative* error due to [catastrophic cancellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophic_cancellation), similar to the examples in lectures 1 and 2.

If the function is differentiable, then the condition number simplifies even further:
* If $x$ and $f(x)$ are scalars, then $\kappa_a = |f'(a)|$ is simply the magnitude of the derivative.
* If $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $f(x) \in \mathbb{R}^m$ are vectors, then $\kappa_a = \Vert J \Vert$ is the ["operator" or "induced" norm](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/OperatorNorm.html) of the [Jacobian matrix J](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant) ($J_{i,j} = \partial f_i /\partial x_j$), where the induced norm $\Vert A \Vert = \sup_{x \ne 0} \frac{\Vert A x \Vert}{\Vert x \Vert}$ measures "how big" a matrix $A$ is by how much it can *stretch* a vector.  (We won't worry too much yet about how to *compute* this induced norm, but if you know the [SVD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition) it is the largest singular value of $A$.)

This leads us to our next important concept, the (relative) condition number $\kappa(A)$ *of a matrix*, and in particular we considered square invertible matrices $A$.   This is defined by first considering the function $f(x) = Ax$.  Its relative condition number, from the above definitions, is $\kappa_r(f, x) = \Vert A \Vert \frac{\Vert x \Vert}{\Vert Ax \Vert}$, which depends upon $x$.  However, if we take the *upper bound* over *all x*, i.e. the *worst x*, then we get $\kappa_r(f, x) \le \Vert A \Vert \cdot \Vert A^{-1} \Vert = \kappa(A)$, the product of the norms of $A$ and its inverse.  Note that $\kappa(A) = \kappa(A^{-1})$: this also tells us the worst case sensitivity for *solving Ax=b* (multiplying by the inverse).  (If you know the SVD, then $\kappa$ is the ratio of the largest and smallest singular values of $A$.)   The condition number is a *dimensionless* (scale-invariant) measure of **how close to singular** the matrix $A$ is.  For example, if two columns of $A$ are nearly parallel, then $\kappa(A)$ will be very large: we say that the matrix is "ill-conditioned" and you should be very careful of inaccuracies when working with it.

For example, we can now explain why the monomial basis was so bad: it is easy to see that the [Vandermonde matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandermonde_matrix) becomes nearly singular for large $n$, since when you take large powers the columns become nearly parallel.  Conversely, it turns out that a "rotation matrix", or more generally any [orthogonal matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_matrix), has condition number equal to **1** (in the $L_2$ norm), and correspondingly using orthogonal polynomials is a much better-behaved basis.

## Lecture 6 ([Feb 14 💕](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine%27s_Day))

* [pset 1 solutions](https://nbviewer.org/github/mitmath/numerical_hub/blob/main/psets/pset1sol.ipynb)
* [pset 2](psets/pset2.ipynb): due Feb 21
* Notes: [OneNote Notebook](https://mitprod-my.sharepoint.com/personal/qiqi_mit_edu/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc={24321bd2-8c69-451a-b0cc-c2b42aed5743}&action=view&wd=target%28Interpolation%20and%20Curve%20Fitting%2F20200214.one%7Cde0fab26-c724-4076-ac58-f6f4e45e33f4%2F%29&wdorigin=717)

Introduced the topic of least-square fitting of data to curves.  As long as the fitting function is linear in the unknown coefficients c (e.g. a polynomial, or some other linear combination of basis functions), showed that minimizing the sum of the squares of the errors corresponds to minimizing the norm of the residual, i.e. the "loss function" L(c) = ‖Ac - y‖², where $A$ is a "tall" matrix whose *rows* correspond to the data points and whose *columns* correspond to the basis functions.  (This is an *overdetermined* linear system because there are more equations than unknowns: we have too few parameters to make the curve go through all the data points in general, unlike interpolation.)

It is a straightforward calculus exercise to show that ∇L = 2Aᵀ(Ac - y), which means that optimal coefficients c can be found by setting the gradient to zero, and ∇L=0 implies the "normal equations" AᵀAc = Aᵀy.   In principle, these can be solved directly, the normal equations square the condition number of A (κ(AᵀA)=κ(A)²) so they are normally solved in a different way, typically by [QR factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_decomposition) of A (or sometimes using the [SVD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition) of A); there are typically library functions that do this for you e.g. `c = numpy.linalg.lstsq(A, y)` in Python or `c = A \ y` in Julia and Matlab.

More generally, minimizing L(c) is an example of an [optimization problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization).  One simple way to attack such problems is by [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent): simply go downhill, in steps Δc = -s∇L where s is the "learning rate" or "step size" parameter (that has to be chosen carefully: too small and it will converge very slowly, but too large and it won't converge at all).  It turns out that an ill-conditioned A also leads to gradient descent that converges slowly (because the local downhill direction -∇L doesn't point to the minimum, necessitating small steps).   Nowadays, naive gradient descent (especially with a fixed learning rate) is a rather primitive technique that has been mostly superseded by better "accelerated" methods, but computing the gradient ∇L and using it to identify the downhill direction is still a key conceptual starting point for many algorithms.   Of course, for least-square fitting where L(c) is linear in c, we can directly solve for c as shown above, but iterative optimization methods are crucial to solve more general problems where the unknowns enter in a nonlinear way (and/or there are constraints).

In both cases, compared the effect of the monomial basis vs. the Chebyshev-polynomial basis.  Because the former leads to an ill-conditioned $A$ at high degrees, the accuracy of the fit quickly saturates due to roundoff errors, especially if you solve AᵀAc = Aᵀy (which squares the condition number); it also leads to slow convergence for gradient descent.  The Chebyshev basis, in contrast, leads to a well-conditioned $A$ (even for equally spaced points, as long as the number of points is much larger than the degree), so it has neither of these problems.

There are many, many books and other materials on [linear least-squares fitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_least_squares), from many different perspectives (e.g. numerical linear algebra, statistics, machine learning…) that you can find online.  The [FastChebInterp.jl package](https://github.com/JuliaMath/FastChebInterp.jl) in Julia does least-square fitting ("regression") with Chebyshev polynomials for you in an optimized way, including multi-dimensional fitting.
